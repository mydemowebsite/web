            Key Takeaway:<br>

            Earth’s global average surface temperature in 2020 tied with 2016 as the hottest year on record, continuing
            a long-term warming trend due to human activities.

            This graph shows the change in global surface temperature compared to the long-term average from 1951 to 1980.
            Nineteen of the hottest years have occurred since 2000, with the exception of 1998.
            The year 2020 tied with 2016 for the hottest year on record since recordkeeping began in 1880 (source: NASA/GISS).
            NASA’s analyses generally match independent analyses prepared by the Climatic Research Unit.

<div><h1><b> EFFECTS OF GLOBAL WARMING ON INDIA</b> </h1>
    <img src="img/india_n.jpg"><p> <font size = 50> It has been projected that if global warming continues with more climatic disasters
        then Indian GDP will decrease to about 9 per cent as there will be a decrease by 40 per cent of the
        production of the main crops. It has been projected that rise of temperatures by two per cent in India will
        displace millions and millions of people.


        After Bangladesh, India is the most flood prone country in the world with approximately 40 million hectares of
        the land at the risk to floods. The most endangered States of India are Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Assam,
        West Bengal, Gujarat, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab and Jammu & Kashmir.

        The impact of global warming has become such that at one time there is a tremendous increase of precipitation
        whereas it becomes minimum later. As a result, severe drought has occurred in the past few centuries in India.
        As India is solely dependent on sustainable and good monsoon for agricultural productivity, the failure of good
        monsoon has an adverse effect on production of crops and finally resulting in droughts. The drought prone
        states are mainly Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Odisha. </font></p>

    <h1><b> Initiatives undertaken by Government for mitigation of Air Pollution</b> </h1>
    <img src = "img/air.webp"><p> <font size = 50>
        Government is taking all efforts for the mitigation of air pollution in the country. Central Government has
        taken a number of regulatory measures for prevention, control and abatement of air pollution in the country.

        Action Plans for Improvement of Air Quality

        The Central Government has launched National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) under the Central Sector “Control of Pollution”
        Scheme as a long-term, time-bound, national level strategy to tackle the air pollution problem across the country
        in a comprehensive manner with targets to achieve 20 % to 30 % reduction in PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations by 2024
        keeping 2017 as the base year for the comparison of concentration.102 non-attainment cities mostly in Indo-Gangetic
        Plains have been identified based on ambient air quality data for the period 2011 – 2015 and WHO report 2014/2018.
        The city specific Action Plans have been approved for all 102 non-attainment cities for implementation on ground.
        The Central Government has notified a Comprehensive Action Plan (CAP) in 2018 identifying timelines and implementing
        agencies for actions identified for prevention, control and mitigation of air pollution in Delhi and NCR.
        Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) was notified on January 12, 2017, for prevention, control and abatement of
        air pollution in Delhi and NCR. It identifies graded measures and implementing agencies for response to four AQI
        categories, namely, Moderate to Poor, Very Poor, Severe and Severe + or Emergency.
        Several steps have been taken for creating awareness amongst the general population. These steps are as follows.
        SAMEER app has been launched wherein air quality information is available to public along with provision for
        registering complaints against air polluting activities. Air quality information collection and dissemination
        are done from a centralized location. It provides real time air quality status to all stakeholders.

    </div>
    <div>
        <h1><b> Social Initiatives</b> </h1>
        <img src = "img/clean_earth.jpg"><p> <font size = 50>
        A dedicated media corner, Twitter and Facebook accounts have been created for access to air quality related
        information and to provide a platform for lodging complaints by general population.
        Crowd sourcing of innovative ideas/ suggestions/proposals from public is done through CPCB website to strengthen
        efforts for improving air quality in Delhi-NCR. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change is
        implementing Environment Education, Awareness and Training Scheme with the objective to promote environmental
        awareness among all sections of the society and to mobilize people’s participation for conservation of environment.
        Under the National Green Corps (NGC) programme of the Ministry, about one lakh schools have been identified as
        Eco-clubs, wherein, nearly thirty lakh students are actively participating in various environment protection and
        conservation activities, including the issues related to the air pollution. Ministry is promoting peoples
        participation and awareness building among citizens for environmental conservation that focus on promotion of
        cycling, saving water and electricity, growing trees, proper maintenance of vehicles, following of lane
        discipline and reducing congestion on roads by car pooling etc. For field feedback on air polluting activities
        in Delhi and major NCR towns, 46 teams of  Central Pollution Control Board have been deployed since October 7, 2019.
        The initiatives taken by the Government for the abatement and control of air pollution in Delhi and NCR since
        2016 have bore good results.     As per Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations (CAAQMS) data, the
        number of ‘Good’, ‘Satisfactory’, and ‘Moderate’ days has progressively increased to 159 in 2018, as compared to
        152 in 2017 and 106 in 2016, and the number of ‘Poor’, ‘Very Poor’ and ‘Severe’ days has reduced to 206, compared
        to 213 in 2017 and 246 in 2016. In Delhi, reduction in PM2.5 levels in 2018 is 7.3% over 2017 and 14.8% over 2016.
        In Delhi, reduction in PM10 levels in 2018 is 8.6% over 2017 and 16.5% over 2016.

                    Small changes will have a great impact and will help us to fight against global warming.
                    For instance, if we use LED bulbs instead of light bulbs and CFLs, we can contribute to the cause.
                    We can spread awareness regarding the emission of different global warming gasses from factory
                    chimneys and domestic appliances. These glasses should be treated before they are released into
                    the atmosphere. We can also pledge to use eco-friendly products that show immense responsibility
                    towards our planet’s crises.We can also stop deforestation and do our part by planting more trees.
                    We need to restrict the use of fossil fuels and seek alternative renewable sources of energy.
